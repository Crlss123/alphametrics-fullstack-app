## Description
This application analyzes and reports graduation rates within specific age ranges across different geographic zones. It presents the data in a real-time dashboard featuring dynamic charts and visualizations, allowing users to monitor trends and compare statistics efficiently.

## Technologies
1. **Frontend**: ReactJS with TypeScript. Used to build a fast, component-based user interface. TypeScript enhances code quality and increases its maintanability by adding static styping.
2. **Backend**: ExpressJS with TypeScript. Handles routing, API endpoints, and business logic including user management, user creation and simulation control. 
3. **Database**: MySQL. A robust and scalable relational database used to store data.

## Main Features
- **Age-Group Segmentation**  
  Analyze graduation rates within age ranges to understand trends specific to different student cohorts.
- **Geographic Zone Filtering**  
  View and compare graduation data across multiple geographic areas, such as cities, districts, or regions.
- **Real-Time Data Updates**  
  Dashboard visualizations update dynamically as new data is ingested, ensuring users have access to the most current information.
- **Interactive Dashboard**  
  Provides users with various charts and graphs to visualize graduation trends clearly and intuitively.
- **Trend Analysis and Reporting**  
  Enables users to track graduation rate changes over time and generate reports to support decision-making.
## My Role
I was responsible for developing the backend of the application, designing and implementing API endpoints to manage data and ensure secure and efficient communication with the database. Additionally, I contributed to the frontend by developing the listing feature for all registered individuals in the system and implementing the CRUD operations for the main entity.

My backend tasks included:

- Designing RESTful APIs for data management and reporting.
- Structuring the database schema to support the application's requirements.
- Handling data validation and error management.
- Collaborating with the frontend team to integrate API endpoints.

On the frontend, I focused on:

- Creating the user interface to display a comprehensive list of registered users.
- Implementing the Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionalities for the primary entity.
- Ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.
